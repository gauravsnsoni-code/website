    <br>
    <p>I’m a Product and Industrial Designer based in Hyderabad, working in R&D within the modular furniture industry. I focus on creating functional, user-centric, and visually refined solutions rooted in innovation and practicality.
<br>
<br>
I am a graduate of NIFT, with a background in Fashion and Lifestyle Accessory Design. This training has strengthened my problem-solving approach, material sensibility, and adaptability, enabling me to seamlessly extend my design practice into product and furniture design while maintaining a strong balance between form, function, and user experience.</p>
